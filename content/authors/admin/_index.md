Welcome! I am an incoming MS student at [Economics](https://econ.duke.edu/) and [Computer Science Departments](https://www.cs.duke.edu/), [Duke University](https://duke.edu/) with half-funded scholarship. I recieved my B.Soc.Sc in Economics (with highest distinction) from [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/) in 2022 (also a [featured graduate](https://econ.fss.um.edu.mo/bachelor-student-placement)). My undergrad advisor is [Professor Tao Li](https://www.um.edu.mo/fss/pa/about_us/staff/TaoLi.html). I was lucky to join his research group and take advanced seminars in political economy and computational methods. I also studied as a funded exchange student at [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/) (2019) and [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) (2021). 

I have a broad interest in the intersection of computer/data science and social science. During my undergrad, I applied causal inference and computational techniques in political economy projects like [elite resettlement](#projects). For my graduate study at Duke, I hope to explore and lean towards the methodology part, e.g., machine learning and causal inference, NLP, etc.      

I also worked as a research intern at [National Survey Research Center at Renmin University of China](http://nsrc.ruc.edu.cn/) on [China Education Panel Survey (CEPS)](http://ceps.ruc.edu.cn/English/Home.htm) in 2020 and a teaching assistant for [Big Data Analysis Foundation (UM)](#teaching) in Spring 2021.
