Welcome! I am a rising senior student from the Faculty of Social Sciences, [University of Macau](https://www.um.edu.mo/). I am majoring in Economics and taking advanced seminars in Politcal Science. I also studied in [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/) (2019) and [Peking University](pku.edu.cn) (2021) as summer exchange student.

I am working as Research Assistant to Professor [Tao LI](https://www.um.edu.mo/fss/pa/about_us/staff/TaoLi.html) with rich experiences in data collection, cleaning and analysis using *R*. Currently I am working on projects regarding *intergenerational economic inequality* with various valuable datasets. I also worked as Research Intern at [National Survey Research Center at Renmin Univeristy of China](http://nsrc.ruc.edu.cn/) in December 2020.

While I am currently on 21/22 Master/Ph.D application cycle, I am also looking for full-time RA positions starting from January 2022! Please feel free to reach me at zhuminghui17@gmail.com.
