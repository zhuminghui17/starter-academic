Previous researches showed that alcohol consumption is related to wages. They suggested an inverse-U-shape relationship between alcohol consumption and wages. However, related researches in China are very limited. In our paper, the CHNS data is used to estimate the relationship between alcohol consumption and hourly wages. By applying the 2SLS estimation, the endogenous problem has been solved. The results show an U-shape relationship between alcohol consumption and hourly wages on male workers, which could be explained by the effect of Chinese unique drinking culture.
